Mio Cid (unity project)
==================================
This repo will contain the source code for the game Mio Cid, a medieval multiplayer ARPG.

Resources
--------------------
- The Unity version will be _2020.3.32f1_
- For multiplayer the game will use a _Node 16.14.2_ server hosted on [another repo](https://github.com/TortitasT/Cid-Server) on this account.
- To make the storyline the game will use ink with it's editor [inky](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/), a handy and flexible storyline maker with integration in unity so the players can make their own campaigns. Each campaign will have a .ink file with knots for each npc.
- To make the campaigns the players will need a map editor, it will be coded to store tiles on a json and load them on runtime. Included on base game (this project).
- To make the graphics we use a technique from the first two diablo games where we make 3d models (using [picoCAD](https://johanpeitz.itch.io/picocad)) and we import them into blender to animate them or whatever, then we render the frames into images for 12 directions.
- To get fonts [OpenFoundry](https://open-foundry.com/fonts)
